                        Your SouthernLanka Aquarium project is a management system for your aquarium business. It handles fish farming, inventory, and sales, allowing you to manage orders for fish, tanks, and supplies. The system uses a MySQL database to track supplier info, payments, and stock levels, with a user-friendly JavaFX interface for managing transactions and customizing orders.

                        Converting your SouthernLanka Aquarium project to a layered architecture involves separating it into distinct layers. The UI layer uses JavaFX for user interactions, such as managing fish sales, inventory, and payments. The business logic layer handles the core operations of the aquarium business, processing transactions and managing stock. The data access layer interacts with the MySQL database to retrieve and update information on suppliers, inventory, and payments. Finally, the database layer stores all relevant business data, ensuring smooth operations. This structure enhances maintainability and scalability.

                        I developed a Connect Four game using Java, which features a simple and intuitive user interface, allowing two players to take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The game checks for win conditions after each move, ensuring smooth and interactive gameplay. This project demonstrates my skills in object-oriented programming, game logic implementation, and user interaction design in Java, making it a great addition to my portfolio.

                        I created an Item Management System that operates through the command line interface (CMD). This system allows users to manage inventory by adding, updating, viewing, and deleting items. I used Java for the backend logic, focusing on item attributes such as ID, name, and price, while providing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The project showcases my ability to handle core programming concepts like input validation, loops, and file handling."

                The Item Management System is a command-line application designed to streamline the process of managing a collection of items in a business or retail environment. It allows users to perform essential inventory management tasks such as adding new items, updating item details, and removing items from the system. The application is text-based and operates through a command-line interface, providing a simple and efficient way to track item information like item ID, name, price, and quantity. Users can also view all stored items or search for specific items by ID or name. This system is ideal for small businesses or projects where a graphical interface is unnecessary, offering a practical solution for basic inventory management.
